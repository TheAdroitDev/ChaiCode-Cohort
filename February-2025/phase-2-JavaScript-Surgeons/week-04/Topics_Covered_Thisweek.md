# Topics Covered This Week (in few words)
## 1. Variables and Data Types
In JavaScript, variables are used to store data. They are an essential part of any programming language, as they allow you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in your programs.

There are a few different ways to declare variables in JavaScript, each with its own syntax and rules. 
--- 
In JavaScript, there are several data types that you can use to store different types of data. Some common data types include:

- Numbers (e.g. 10, 3.14)
- Strings (e.g. "hello", 'world')
- Booleans (e.g. true, false)
- Arrays (e.g. [1, 2, 3])
- Objects (e.g. { name: "John", age: 30 })

## 2. Operators
Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform specific operations on one or more operands (values or variables). For example, the addition operator (+) adds two operands together and the assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.

There are several types of operators in JavaScript, including:

1. Arithmetic operators (e.g. +, -, *, /, %)
1. Comparison operators (e.g. >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
1. Logical operators (e.g. &&, ||, !)
1. Assignment operators (e.g. =, +=, -=, *=, /=)
1. Conditional (ternary) operator (e.g. ?:)
1. Expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators that produce a result.

## 3. Conditions if-else-if ladder and switch case

## If-else
The "if" statement in JavaScript is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met. The "else" clause is used to execute a block of code if the condition is not met.

Here is the basic syntax for an "if" statement:

The condition is a boolean expression that evaluates to either true or false. If the condition is true, the code in the "if" block is executed. If the condition is false, the code in the "else" block is executed (if present).


### Switch Case
In this structure, the "expression" is evaluated and compared to each of the "case" values. If the "expression" matches a "case" value, the corresponding block of code is executed. The "break" statement is used to exit the "switch" statement and prevent the code in the following cases from being executed. The "default" case is optional and is executed if the "expression" does not match any of the "case" values.
The "switch" statement in JavaScript is another control structure that allows you to execute a different block of code depending on a specific value. It is often used as an alternative to the "if-else ladder" when you have multiple conditions to check against a single value.
