## This Week Topics Covered

### 1. How The Internet Works  
The internet is a global network that connects millions of computers, allowing them to communicate and share information. When you access a website, your device sends a request to the web server hosting that site. This request travels through several networks, using protocols like TCP/IP to ensure reliable data transmission. The server responds by sending back the requested data, which your browser displays as a web page.

### 2. Understanding The Backbone of The Internet  
The internet’s backbone is a collection of high-capacity data routes and core routers that connect large networks worldwide. It consists of submarine cables, satellite links, and major data centers. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) connect end users to the backbone, ensuring seamless global connectivity. Key protocols like BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) help manage data flow and routing across networks.

### 3. (WWW) World Wide Web  
The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interconnected documents and multimedia that users access via web browsers. Unlike the internet (which is the infrastructure), the web is an application built on top of it. It uses protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS to retrieve and display content. Websites are hosted on web servers and can be accessed using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).

### 4. How The Internet Works  
The internet works through a combination of hardware and software protocols. Devices like routers, switches, and servers manage data flow, while protocols like DNS, TCP/IP, and HTTP guide how data is transmitted and displayed. When you type a URL in your browser, DNS translates it into an IP address, connecting you to the corresponding server. Data packets are sent back and forth, allowing you to view the content.

 ### 4. What Is DNS and How Does It Work?  
The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the internet’s phonebook. It translates human-readable domain names (like `www.chaicode.com`) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other.  

When you enter a URL in your browser:  
1. **DNS Query:** Your device sends a query to the DNS resolver.  
2. **Recursive Search:** The resolver checks several DNS servers to find the corresponding IP address.  
3. **Response:** Once the IP is found, it sends the response back to your browser.  
4. **Connection:** Your browser uses the IP address to connect to the web server and load the website.  

Without DNS, we’d have to remember complex IP addresses instead of simple domain names.
