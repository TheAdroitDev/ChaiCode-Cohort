### Prominence of Network Protocols

Seamless Communication: Imagine trying to get two people who speak different languages to have a conversation without a translator. That’s what would happen without Internet protocols. These protocols act as the universal translator, allowing devices — whether it’s a Windows laptop or a Linux server — to communicate effortlessly, no matter their operating system or hardware.

Data Integrity: Protocols ensure that the data you send is received just as it was intended. It’s like sending a letter that arrives intact, with every word in the right order and no missing pages. Whether you're sending an email or streaming a video, protocols keep the data safe and intact during transmission.

Efficiency: Ever wondered how information moves so quickly across the internet? Protocols optimize the entire process. They decide how to package, route, and transmit your data, cutting down on unnecessary steps and ensuring faster, smoother communication.

Scalability: The internet is vast, with billions of devices constantly talking to each other. Thanks to protocols, this massive network can keep growing without slowing down. They ensure that, whether you’re connecting a smartphone, a smart fridge, or a self-driving car, everything can work together without a hitch.

Security: With protocols like HTTPS and SSL/TLS, your personal information is shielded from prying eyes. These security protocols encrypt your data, creating a secure channel for online transactions, shopping, or simply browsing the web.

Global Standardization: Without a common framework, chaos would ensue. Protocols act as the universal rules that help devices from different parts of the world communicate with each other. They create harmony across the global network, allowing systems to work together seamlessly, no matter where you are.

### TCP / UDP , Which one’s great?

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two fundamental communication protocols used for transmitting data over the internet. Now you are sending information over the requests here comes the transport layer
