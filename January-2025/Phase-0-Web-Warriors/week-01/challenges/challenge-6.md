### HTTP and HTTPS Protocols  

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** and **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)** are the protocols used to transfer data over the web. They enable communication between your browser and the web server.  

#### 1. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)  
- A stateless protocol that transfers data in plain text.  
- It operates on **port 80**.  
- Not secureâ€”data can be intercepted by attackers (man-in-the-middle attacks).  
- Commonly used for non-sensitive content.  

#### 2. HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)  
- The secure version of HTTP. It encrypts data using **SSL/TLS** to protect communication.  
- It operates on **port 443**.  
- Ensures data integrity, confidentiality, and authentication.  
- Widely used for secure transactions (e.g., banking, e-commerce).  

**Major Difference:**  
- HTTP transfers data without encryption, while HTTPS secures the data using encryption. This makes HTTPS essential for protecting sensitive information.
