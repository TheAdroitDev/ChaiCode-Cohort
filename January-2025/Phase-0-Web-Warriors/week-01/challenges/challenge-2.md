###  What Is DNS and How Does It Work?  
The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the internet’s phonebook. It translates human-readable domain names (like `www.chaicode.com`) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other.  

When you enter a URL in your browser:  
1. **DNS Query:** Your device sends a query to the DNS resolver.  
2. **Recursive Search:** The resolver checks several DNS servers to find the corresponding IP address.  
3. **Response:** Once the IP is found, it sends the response back to your browser.  
4. **Connection:** Your browser uses the IP address to connect to the web server and load the website.  

Without DNS, we’d have to remember complex IP addresses instead of simple domain names.
