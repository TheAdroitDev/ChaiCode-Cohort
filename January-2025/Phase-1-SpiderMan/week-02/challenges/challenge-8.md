### Introduction

Think about the last website you visited—its foundation is built using HTML, the language that gives structure to the web. To comprehend it more, HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It's a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements on a webpage. Think of it as the building blocks that create the structure and look of a website, similar to how bricks and mortar are used to build a house.

In a nutshell:

- HTML is the language of the web, used to create websites.

- HTML defines the barebone structure or layout of web pages that we see on the Internet.

- HTML consists of a set of tags contained within an HTML document, and the associated files typically have either a ".html" or ".htm" extension.

- There are several versions of HTML, with HTML5 being the most recent version.
